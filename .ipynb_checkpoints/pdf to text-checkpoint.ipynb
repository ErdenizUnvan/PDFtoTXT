      "I propose to consider the question, \"Can machines think?\" This should begin with \n",
      "definitions of the meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\" The definitions might be \n",
      "framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is \n",
      "dangerous, If the meaning of the words \"machine\" and \"think\" are to be found by \n",
      "examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the \n",
      "meaning and the answer to the question, \"Can machines think?\" is to be sought in a \n",
      "statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a \n",
      "definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is \n",
      "expressed in relatively unambiguous words. \n",
      "The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the \n",
      "'imitation game.\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an \n",
      "interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the \n",
      "other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other \n",
      "two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the \n",
      "end of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is B and Y is A.\" The \n",
      "interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: \n",
      "C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? \n",
      "Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and \n",
      "cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be: \n",
      "\"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.\" \n",
      "In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, \n",
      "or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating \n",
      "between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an \n",
      "intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. \n",
      "The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as \n",
      "\"I am the woman, don't listen to him!\" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man \n",
      "can make similar remarks.  \n",
      "We now ask the question, \"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this \n",

      "he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace \n",

      "2. Critique of the New Problem \n",
      "As well as asking, \"What is the answer to this new form of the question,\" one may ask, \n",
      "\"Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?\" This latter question we investigate \n",
      "without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress. \n",
      "The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical \n",
      "and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to \n",
      "produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at \n",
      "some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel \n",
      "there was little point in trying to make a \"thinking machine\" more human by dressing it \n",
      "up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in \n",
      "the condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other \n",
      "competitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion \n",
      "may be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus: \n",
      "Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. \n",
      "A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. \n",
      "Q: Add 34957 to 70764. \n",

      "Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your \n",
      "move. What do you play?  \n",
      "A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. \n",
      "The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of \n",
      "the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include. We do not wish to penalise the \n",
      "machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing \n",

      "irrelevant. The \"witnesses\" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please \n",
      "about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical \n",
      "demonstrations. \n",
      "The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily \n",
      "against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would \n",
      "clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and \n",
      "inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be \n",
      "described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is \n",
      "a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be \n",
      "constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this \n",
      "objection. \n",
      "It might be urged that when playing the \"imitation game\" the best strategy for the \n",
      "machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This \n",
      "may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case \n",
      "there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that \n",
      "the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man. \n",
      "3. The Machines Concerned in the Game \n",
      "The question which we put in 1 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we \n",
      "mean by the word \"machine.\" It is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of \n",
      "engineering technique to be used in our machines. We also wish to allow the possibility \n",
      "than an engineer or team of engineers may construct a machine which works, but whose \n",
      "manner of operation cannot be satisfactorily described by its constructors because they \n",
      "have applied a method which is largely experimental. Finally, we wish to exclude from \n",
      "the machines men born in the usual manner. It is difficult to frame the definitions so as to \n",
      "satisfy these three conditions. One might for instance insist that the team of engineers \n",
      "should be all of one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably \n",
      "possible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a man. To do \n",
      "so would be a feat of biological technique deserving of the very highest praise, but we \n",
      "would not be inclined to regard it as a case of \"constructing a thinking machine.\" This \n",
      "prompts us to abandon the requirement that every kind of technique should be permitted. \n",
      "We are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in \"thinking \n",
      "machines\" has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an \"electronic \n",
      "computer\" or \"digital computer.\" Following this suggestion we only permit digital \n",
      "computers to take part in our game. \n",
      "This restriction appears at first sight to be a very drastic one. I shall attempt to show that \n",
      "it is not so in reality. To do this necessitates a short account of the nature and properties \n",
      "of these computers. \n",
      "It may also be said that this identification of machines with digital computers, like our \n",
      "criterion for \"thinking,\" will only be unsatisfactory if (contrary to my belief), it turns out \n",
      "that digital computers are unable to give a good showing in the game. \n",
      "There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, \n",
      "\"Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of \n",
      "the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how \n",
      "often the right identification was given.\" The short answer is that we are not asking \n",
      "whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers at \n",
      "present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which \n",
      "would do well. But this is only the short answer. We shall see this question in a different \n",

      "4. Digital Computers \n",
      "The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are \n",
      "intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer. The \n",
      "human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate \n",
      "from them in any detail. We may suppose that these rules are supplied in a book, which is \n",
      "altered whenever he is put on to a new job. He has also an unlimited supply of paper on \n",
      "which he does his calculations. He may also do his multiplications and additions on a \n",
      "\"desk machine,\" but this is not important. \n",
      "If we use the above explanation as a definition we shall be in danger of circularity of \n",
      "argument. We avoid this by giving an outline. of the means by which the desired effect is \n",
      "achieved. A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts: \n",
      "(i) Store. \n",
      "(ii) Executive unit. \n",
      "(iii) Control. \n",
      "The store is a store of information, and corresponds to the human computer's paper, \n",
      "whether this is the paper on which he does his calculations or that on which his book of \n",
      "rules is printed. In so far as the human computer does calculations in his bead a part of \n",
      "the store will correspond to his memory. \n",
      "The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved \n",
      "in a calculation. What these individual operations are will vary from machine to machine. \n",
      "Usually fairly lengthy operations can be done such as \"Multiply 3540675445 by \n",
      "7076345687\" but in some machines only very simple ones such as \"Write down 0\" are \n",
      "possible.  \n",
      "We have mentioned that the \"book of rules\" supplied to the computer is replaced in the \n",
      "machine by a part of the store. It is then called the \"table of instructions.\" It is the duty of \n",
      "the control to see that these instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. The \n",
      "control is so constructed that this necessarily happens. \n",
      "The information in the store is usually broken up into packets of moderately small size. In \n",
      "one machine, for instance, a packet might consist of ten decimal digits. Numbers are \n",
      "assigned to the parts of the store in which the various packets of information are stored, \n",
      "in some systematic manner. A typical instruction might say- \n",
      "\"Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the \n",
      "latter storage position.\"  \n",
      "Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more \n",
      "likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible \n",
      "operations is to be performed on the two numbers. In this case the)e operation is that \n",
      "described above, viz., \"Add the number. . . .\" It will be noticed that the instruction takes \n",
      "up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information, very conveniently. The control will \n",
      "normally take the instructions to be obeyed in the order of the positions in which they are \n",
      "stored, but occasionally an instruction such as \n",
      "\"Now obey the instruction stored in position 5606, and continue from there\" \n",
      "may be encountered, or again \n",
      "\"If position 4505 contains 0 obey next the instruction stored in 6707, otherwise continue \n",
      "straight on.\" \n",
      "Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it possible for a \n",
      "sequence of operations to be replaced over and over again until some condition is \n",
      "fulfilled, but in doing so to obey, not fresh instructions on each repetition, but the same \n",
      "ones over and over again. To take a domestic analogy. Suppose Mother wants Tommy to \n",
      "call at the cobbler's every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she \n",
      "can ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice once and for all \n",
      "in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school and which tells him to call for the \n",
      "shoes, and also to destroy the notice when he comes back if he has the shoes with him. \n",
      "The reader must accept it as a fact that digital computers can be constructed, and indeed \n",
      "have been constructed, according to the principles we have described, and that they can in \n",
      "fact mimic the actions of a human computer very closely. \n",
      "The book of rules which we have described our human computer as using is of course a \n",
      "convenient fiction. Actual human computers really remember what they have got to do. If \n",
      "one wants to make a machine mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some \n",
      "complex operation one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into \n",
      "the form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually described as \n",
      "\"programming.\" To \"programme a machine to carry out the operation A\" means to put \n",
      "the appropriate instruction table into the machine so that it will do A. \n",
      "An interesting variant on the idea of a digital computer is a \"digital computer with a \n",
      "random element.\" These have instructions involving the throwing of a die or some \n",
      "equivalent electronic process; one such instruction might for instance be, \"Throw the die \n",
      "and put the-resulting number into store 1000.\" Sometimes such a machine is described as \n",
      "having free will (though I would not use this phrase myself), It is not normally possible to \n",
      "determine from observing a machine whether it has a random element, for a similar effect \n",
      "can be produced by such devices as making the choices depend on the digits of the \n",
      "decimal for . \n",
      "Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no theoretical difficulty in \n",
      "the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been \n",
      "used at any one time. Likewise only a finite amount can have been constructed, but we \n",
      "can imagine more and more being added as required. Such computers have special \n",
      "theoretical interest and will be called infinitive capacity computers. \n",
      "The idea of a digital computer is an old one. Charles Babbage, Lucasian Professor of \n",
      "Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839, planned such a machine, called the \n",
      "Analytical Engine, but it was never completed. Although Babbage had all the essential \n",
      "ideas, his machine was not at that time such a very attractive prospect. The speed which \n",
      "would have been available would be definitely faster than a human computer but \n",
      "something like I 00 times slower than the Manchester machine, itself one of the slower of \n",
      "the modern machines, The storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards. \n",
      "The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical will help us to \n",
      "rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital \n",
      "computers are electrical, and that the nervous system also is electrical. Since Babbage's \n",
      "machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we \n",
      "see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. Of course electricity \n",
      "usually comes in where fast signalling is concerned, so that it is not surprising that we \n",
      "find it in both these connections. In the nervous system chemical phenomena are at least \n",
      "as important as electrical. In certain computers the storage system is mainly acoustic. The \n",
      "feature of using electricity is thus seen to be only a very superficial similarity. If we wish \n",
      "to find such similarities we should took rather for mathematical analogies of function.  \n",
      "5. Universality of Digital Computers \n",
      "The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the \n",
      "\"discrete-state machines.\" These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks \n",
      "from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the \n",
      "possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking there, are no such \n",
      "machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine \n",
      "which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in \n",
      "considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch \n",
      "must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most \n",
      "purposes we can forget about them. As an example of a discrete-state machine we might \n",
      "consider a wheel which clicks round through 120 once a second, but may be stopped by a \n",
      "]ever which can be operated from outside; in addition a lamp is to light in one of the \n",
      "positions of the wheel. This machine could be described abstractly as follows. The \n",
      "internal state of the machine (which is described by the position of the wheel) may be q , \n",
      "1\n",
      "q  or q . There is an input signal i0. or i1 (position of ]ever). The internal state at any \n",
      "2 3\n",
      "moment is determined by the last state and input signal according to the table \n",
      "(TABLE DELETED) \n",
      " \n",
      "The output signals, the only externally visible indication of the internal state (the light) \n",
      "are described by the table \n",
      "State q q  q\n",
      "1  2 3\n",
      "output o  o  o\n",
      "0 0 1\n",
      "This example is typical of discrete-state machines. They can be described by such tables \n",
      "provided they have only a finite number of possible states. \n",
      "It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always \n",
      "possible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the \n",
      "complete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and \n",
      "velocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction \n",
      "which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered \n",
      "by Laplace. The system of the \"universe as a whole\" is such that quite small errors in the \n",
      "initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a \n",
      "single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference \n",
      "between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential \n",
      "property of the mechanical systems which we have called \"discrete-state machines\" that \n",
      "this phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines \n",
      "instead of the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one \n",
      "moment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps later.  \n",
      "As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines. \n",
      "But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large. \n",
      "For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about 2 165,000, \n",
      "i.e., about 10 50,000. Compare this with our example of the clicking wheel described \n",
      "above, which had three states. It is not difficult to see why the number of states should be \n",
      "so immense. The computer includes a store corresponding to the paper used by a human \n",
      "computer. It must be possible to write into the store any one of the combinations of \n",
      "symbols which might have been written on the paper. For simplicity suppose that only \n",
      "digits from 0 to 9 are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose \n",
      "the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for \n",
      "30 digits. Then the number of states is 10 100x50x30 i.e., 10 150,000 . This is about the number \n",
      "of states of three Manchester machines put together. The logarithm to the base two of the \n",
      "number of states is usually called the \"storage capacity\" of the machine. Thus the \n",
      "Manchester machine has a storage capacity of about 165,000 and the wheel machine of \n",
      "our example about 1.6. If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to \n",
      "obtain the capacity of the resultant machine. This leads to the possibility of statements \n",
      "such as \"The Manchester machine contains 64 magnetic tracks each with a capacity of \n",
      "2560, eight electronic tubes with a capacity of 1280. Miscellaneous storage amounts to \n",
      "about 300 making a total of 174,380.\"  \n",
      "Given the table corresponding to a discrete-state machine it is possible to predict what it \n",
      "will do. There is no reason why this calculation should not be carried out by means of a \n",
      "digital computer. Provided it could be carried out sufficiently quickly the digital \n",
      "computer could mimic the behavior of any discrete-state machine. The imitation game \n",
      "could then be played with the machine in question (as B) and the mimicking digital \n",
      "computer (as A) and the interrogator would be unable to distinguish them. Of course the \n",
      "digital computer must have an adequate storage capacity as well as working sufficiently \n",
      "fast. Moreover, it must be programmed afresh for each new machine which it is desired \n",
      "to mimic. \n",
      "This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete-state \n",
      "machine, is described by saying that they are universal machines. The existence of \n",
      "machines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed \n",
      "apart, it is unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing \n",
      "processes. They can all be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each \n",
      "case. It 'ill be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in a sense \n",
      "equivalent. \n",
      "We may now consider again the point raised at the end of §3. It was suggested tentatively \n",
      "that the question, \"Can machines think?\" should be replaced by \"Are there imaginable \n",
      "digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\" If we wish we can make \n",
      "this superficially more general and ask \"Are there discrete-state machines which would \n",

      "that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed \n",
      "of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play \n",
      "satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?\" \n",
      "6. Contrary Views on the Main Question \n",
      "We may now consider the ground to have been cleared and we are ready to proceed to the \n",
      "debate on our question, \"Can machines think?\" and the variant of it quoted at the end of \n",
      "the last section. We cannot altogether abandon the original form of the problem, for \n",

      "(1) The Theological Objection \n",
      "Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every \n",
      "man and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or \n",
      "machine can think. \n",
      "I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in theological terms. I \n",
      "should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is \n",
      "a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than \n",
      "there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view \n",
      "becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious \n",
      "community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? But \n",
      "let us leave this point aside and return to the main argument. It appears to me that the \n",
      "argument quoted above implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty. \n",
      "It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to \n",
      "two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He \n",
      "sees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a \n",
      "mutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to \n",
      "the needs of this sort[. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of \n",
      "machines. It may seem different because it is more difficult to \"swallow.\" But this really \n",
      "only means that we think it would be less likely that He would consider the \n",
      "circumstances suitable for conferring a soul. The circumstances in question are discussed \n",
      "in the rest of this paper. In attempting to construct such machines we should not be \n",
      "irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the \n",
      "procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing \n",
      ".mansions for the souls that He creates. \n",
      "However, this is mere speculation. I am not very impressed with theological arguments \n",
      "whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found \n",
      "unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, \"And the sun \n",
      "stood still . . . and hasted not to go down about a whole day\" (Joshua x. 13) and \"He laid \n",
      "the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time\" (Psalm cv. 5) were an \n",
      "adequate refutation of the Copernican theory. With our present knowledge such an \n",
      "argument appears futile. When that knowledge was not available it made a quite different \n",
      "impression.  \n",
      "(2) The \"Heads in the Sand\" Objection  \n",
      "The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe \n",
      "that they cannot do so.\"  \n",
      "This argument is seldom expressed quite so openly as in the form above. But it affects \n",
      "most of us who think about it at all. We like to believe that Man is in some subtle way \n",
      "superior to the rest of creation. It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for \n",
      "then there is no danger of him losing his commanding position. The popularity of the \n",
      "theological argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be quite strong \n",
      "in intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking more highly than others, and \n",
      "are more inclined to base their belief in the superiority of Man on this power.  \n",

      "Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be sought in the \n",
      "transmigration of souls. \n",
      "(3) The Mathematical Objection \n",
      "There are a number of results of mathematical logic which can be used to show that there \n",
      "are limitations to the powers of discrete-state machines. The best known of these results \n",
      "is known as Godel's theorem ( 1931 ) and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical \n",
      "system statements can be formulated which can neither be proved nor disproved within \n",
      "the system, unless possibly the system itself is inconsistent. There are other, in some \n",
      "respects similar, results due to Church (1936), Kleene (1935), Rosser, and Turing (1937). \n",
      "The latter result is the most convenient to consider, since it refers directly to machines, \n",
      "whereas the others can only be used in a comparatively indirect argument: for instance if \n",
      "Godel's theorem is to be used we need in addition to have some means of describing \n",
      "logical systems in terms of machines, and machines in terms of logical systems. The \n",
      "result in question refers to a type of machine which is essentially a digital computer with \n",
      "an infinite capacity. It states that there are certain things that such a machine cannot do. If \n",
      "it is rigged up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game, there will be some \n",
      "questions to which it will either give a wrong answer, or fail to give an answer at all \n",
      "however much time is allowed for a reply. There may, of course, be many such questions, \n",
      "and questions which cannot be answered by one machine may be satisfactorily answered \n",
      "by another. We are of course supposing for the present that the questions are of the kind \n",
      "to which an answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" is appropriate, rather than questions such as \"What do \n",
      "you think of Picasso?\" The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this \n",
      "type, \"Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' \n",
      "to any question?\" The dots are to be replaced by a description of some machine in a \n",
      "standard form, which could be something like that used in §5. When the machine \n",
      "described bears a certain comparatively simple relation to the machine which is under \n",
      "interrogation, it can be shown that the answer is either wrong or not forthcoming. This is \n",
      "the mathematical result: it is argued that it proves a disability of machines to which the \n",
      "human intellect is not subject. \n",
      "The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are \n",
      "limitations to the Powers If any particular machine, it has only been stated, without any \n",
      "sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not think this \n",
      "view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the \n",
      "appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must \n",
      "be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory? It is no \n",
      "doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much importance should be attached to it. We \n",
      "too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased \n",
      "at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines. Further, our superiority can \n",
      "only be felt on such an occasion in relation to the one machine over which we have \n",
      "scored our petty triumph. There would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over \n",
      "all machines. In short, then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but \n",
      "then again there might be other machines cleverer again, and so on. \n",
      "Those who hold to the mathematical argument would, I think, mostly he willing to accept \n",
      "the imitation game as a basis for discussion, Those who believe in the two previous \n",
      "objections would probably not be interested in any criteria. \n",
      "(4) The Argument from Consciousness \n",
      "This argument is very, well expressed in Professor Jefferson's Lister Oration for 1949, \n",
      "from which I quote. \"Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto \n",
      "because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we \n",
      "agree that machine equals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. \n",
      "No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) \n",
      "pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made \n",
      "miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get \n",
      "what it wants.\" \n",
      "This argument appears to be a denial of the validity of our test. According to the most \n",
      "extreme form of this view the only way by which one could be sure that machine thinks \n",
      "is to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking. One could then describe these feelings \n",
      "to the world, but of course no one would be justified in taking any notice. Likewise \n",
      "according to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular \n",
      "man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view. It may be the most logical view to hold but it \n",
      "makes communication of ideas difficult. A is liable to believe \"A thinks but B does not\" \n",
      "whilst B believes \"B thinks but A does not.\" instead of arguing continually over this point \n",
      "it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks. \n",
      "I am sure that Professor Jefferson does not wish to adopt the extreme and solipsist point \n",
      "of view. Probably he would be quite willing to accept the imitation game as a test. The \n",
      "game (with the player B omitted) is frequently used in practice under the name of viva \n",
      "voce to discover whether some one really understands something or has \"learnt it parrot \n",
      "fashion.\" Let us listen in to a part of such a viva voce: \n",
      "Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads \"Shall I compare thee to a \n",
      "summer's day,\" would not \"a spring day\" do as well or better? \n",
      "Witness: It wouldn't scan. \n",
      "Interrogator: How about \"a winter's day,\" That would scan all right. \n",
      "Witness: Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day. \n",
      "Interrogator: Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas? \n",
      "Witness: In a way. \n",
      "Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick would \n",
      "mind the comparison. \n",
      "Witness: I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a typical winter's day, \n",
      "rather than a special one like Christmas. \n",
      "And so on, What would Professor Jefferson say if the sonnet-writing machine was able to \n",
      "answer like this in the viva voce? I do not know whether he would regard the machine as \n",
      "\"merely artificially signalling\" these answers, but if the answers were as satisfactory and \n",
      "sustained as in the above passage I do not think he would describe it as \"an easy \n",
      "contrivance.\" This phrase is, I think, intended to cover such devices as the inclusion in \n",
      "the machine of a record of someone reading a sonnet, with appropriate switching to turn \n",
      "it on from time to time. \n",
      "In short then, I think that most of those who support the argument from consciousness \n",
      "could be persuaded to abandon it rather than be forced into the solipsist position. They \n",
      "will then probably be willing to accept our test. \n",
      "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. \n",
      "There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. \n",
      "But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the \n",
      "question with which we are concerned in this paper. \n",
      "(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities \n",
      "These arguments take the form, \"I grant you that you can make machines do all the things \n",
      "you have mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X.\" Numerous features \n",
      "X are suggested in this connexion I offer a selection:  \n",

      "thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new. \n",
      "No support is usually offered for these statements. I believe they are mostly founded on \n",
      "the principle of scientific induction. A man has seen thousands of machines in his \n",
      "lifetime. From what he sees of them he draws a number of general conclusions. They are \n",
      "ugly, each is designed for a very limited purpose, when required for a minutely different \n",
      "purpose they are useless, the variety of behaviour of any one of them is very small, etc., \n",
      "etc. Naturally he concludes that these are necessary properties of machines in general. \n",
